## Hello :)

- My challenge was to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## Task
The task was to build out the project to the design inside the `/design` folder (desktop version of the design).
the required assets are in the `/images` folder. 
There is a `style-guide.md` file containing the information, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building the project
The project was done in Visual Studio Code using HTML and CSS.
